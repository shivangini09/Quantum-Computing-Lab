        "In this notebook, I have simulated the BB84 Quantum Key Distribution protocol.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key observations:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Random bases ensure that qubit preparation is unpredictable.\n",
        "- Matching bases between Alice and Bob lead to a correct sifted key.\n",
        "- In the absence of an eavesdropper, QBER remains near zero.\n",
        "- An intercept–resend attack by Eve introduces a QBER of ~25%, which allows Alice and Bob to detect eavesdropping with high confidence.\n",
        "\n",
        "This simulation highlights the core security principle of QKD:\n",
        "any attempt to measure quantum information unavoidably disturbs it, making eavesdropping detectable.\n",
        "\n",
        "BB84 therefore provides **information-theoretic security** based on quantum mechanics.\n"
